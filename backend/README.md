## How to Run the Backend

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install Python dependencies, and start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This will create a backend REST API running on port 5000, which is used to interact with the upload page in the React frontend.
